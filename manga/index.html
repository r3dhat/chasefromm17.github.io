I'm Chase Fromm. I have Asperger's syndrome. I met a girlfriend. She was born in 2001, Alyssa Nuuk Kuron and she was born in Tokyo. I had no idea she'd later become my (nearly-psychopathic) girlfriend who's also take me on pretty awesome adventures. She also had Asperger's syndrome.

She was born a few months before September 11, 2001 came around. At that time, the United States was under attack by Arabic airline, not Japanese airline. Her mom, Olivia Inayatu Kuron, moved up to Kansas City after her dad, Tsukune Kuron, died in the second World Trade Center after it had collapsed.

She drove up from the Kansas City airport to my doorstep, and left my mother and father to take care of her for a year, then along came a police officer named Vick Newman. Vick was 29 years old. He was fat, had a bald head, and wore a white t-shirt. He also wore glasses. He also took care of us and raised us and some of my friends who came before to this house like Billy Ellis, Luca Todesco, Karen Tsai, and Stefan Esser for years and years.

Within 13 years, Alyssa and I were literally boyfriend and girlfriend. She and I were diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome in late 2013. She had Vick drive her over from home to work, and to work to home. He was member of the iPhone and Apple community.

Alyssa and I kind of have trouble communicating. She can be unclear in what she says, as can I at times. One day, she was out the door to go home from her job at Apple Store, when Vick was taking her home after she was pissed at her manager.
"HEY ASS! TURN UP THE DAMN RADIO, BAE!"
"Would you hush?"
"Dude, oh my God, seriously, turn the fucking radio on!!!"
"Ok."

Minutes later, they came up to my house. My parents were not around.

On that topic, my parents literally went to Croatia for an unknown reason one day.

The car pulled up in the driveway. I saw it pull up to the driveway after Billy Ellis, told me.
"HEY DUDE, CHASE, GET UP HERE! ALYSSA'S HERE!"

Vick got out of the car, and Alyssa pulled off her pink and striped hoodie and hit it at Vick because she was pissed at how he couldn't turn the radio to a different station. Seriously?

Alyssa wore a big striped hoodie with a skirt that was blue, a head band, and wore earmuffs, because it's nearly the end of February

She and Vick came up to my doorstep. Vick also introduced himself. He's actually never met me before, and neither had Alyssa.

After we were introduced to each other and said hello, I said "Ok, come on in. My friends are in the basement."

They came in.
Alyssa looked around.
"Uh… what… the… fuck… is this place?! Dude, this is NOT a fucking normal home! Seriously, b! There's snow everywhere, the house is weird, and I don't know what the fuck even is wrong with me coming into some cute boy's house.", she thought.

Alyssa and I went downstairs to introduce ourselves to Karen Tsai, Stefan Esser, and Luca Todesco. Vick went into the kitchen to get something to eat.

Both of us went to the basement. Right when we came to the stairway, Alyssa said "Dude, wow. The walls are all, like, blood red! Kickass!"
"I know, right?" I said.
We both walked downstairs.
"Who the hell does Chase have over now?", said a voice.
"Excuse me?", said Alyssa.
"Oh, hello!", said the voice again. It was Karen Tsai. He was tall, and he wore a red hoodie and had Despicable Me minion doll with him.
There was a 10 second pause. She looked at him blankly. She was kind of mad at him.
"Hi?"
"Dafuq yo ass doin' with a fuckin' minion buddy, b? You have Asperger's like I do or is yo Arab ass drunk af?"
Karen and I starred at her and were appalled.
"Wow.. that was.. really rude, and yes, actually I do have Asperger's too just like Chase does. Are you his girlfriend? I used to watch the best scenes of Despicable Me! What's your name?"
"Mhm! I'm from Japan? I'm Alysaa Nuuk Kuron. You? Oh crap, lemme get my homework out, sorry."
She got her backpack out.
"Oh, ok. By the way, I'm from England. But I look Arabic.. so, yeah, That's actually a pretty awkward thing I'm Arabi--"
She hit in with her hands.. with her knife.
"You.. fuck. OK, HEY ASSHOLE! FUCK YOU FOR DOING 9/11! WORTHLESS ASPIE CUNT SANDNIGGER!"

She dropped her knife.

Everyone looked at her with frustration, fear, and embarrassment.

Luca took a video recording from his iPhone 6. He was mad.
"Uh, I'd really watch yourself", me and Luca said.
Luca walked over to her. Luca was a young Mexican guy who was a tall, pumps man. He sported glasses and wore a grey hoodie that had the Apple logo. The Apple logo was eating an Android mascot. It had teeth.

"Wh-- why-- THE…"
Karen, Luca, and even Stefan and Alyssa, and eventually Vick and I came down to see her crazy behavior.

Karen hit her back, thankfully not with her knife.
"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU YOU PSYCHO?!"
"Well, hey. Maybe if you and your creepy friends, excluding Chase, hadn't attacked the World Trade Center, we wouldn't have that kinda problem, WOULD WE, BOY?! Mhmm.. cunt."
"Crazy girl!", said Vick.
"You need to get a hospital asap, Alyssa.", said Stefan.
"No. She needs to just fuck off and kill herself. Fucking nut.", said Billy.
"Stop it, guys!", yelled Luca.

Everyone saw Luca. He was kind of mad at them all, except for Alyssa, Karen and I.

"Asshole.", whispered Alyssa.
A big pause came. The dialogue came to a halt.
"…Guys, come on over to the table, please. Thanks.", I said.

30 minutes later came by. In between those times, everyone discussed their issues. Alyssa found out that Karen, Billy, Luca, Vick, and Stefan were actually living at my house, and they discussed that it was sort of like an orphanage, as my mother and father were out in the world.

Alyssa then asked Vick, "Wanna hear a secret?"
"I'm not sure if it is appropriate or inappropriate. Is it appropriate or inappropriate?"
"Appropriate. Duh.", she said.
"Yes, ask away!"

Before she got to the question, she got her knife.

She came over to him and Karen.
She pinned him and Karen down.
She duck taped his and Karen's mouth.
Everyone was quite scared at what this bizarre chick could do.
There was a pause. She was too dominant and too out of control.. and too personal.
Then she spoke out.
Alyssa gave the CRAZIEST death glare. She was furious as all hell.
"Let me give you and Karen here AND YOUR CRAZY FRIENDS a warning, pal… Don't you EVER… EVER… fuck with me. of my family again… EVER! If I see you EVER fucking me ov--"
"Alyssa?", I asked.
"GO SUCK AND FUCK SOME PUSSY AND FUCK OFF, BITCH, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!!!"
"Anyway. Where was I. If you ever, ever, EVER try to kill me just like you did with my parents, I'll make you a draw back a stump! Now, get up! Unfuck yourself! Both of ya! GOT IT!"
"FUCK YOU!", they said.
She kicked them and walked away.
Billy, Stefan, and Luca pulled Karen, and Vick aside.

Alyssa was officially a serial killing psychopath.. and my official and first and only girlfriend.

The situation came to a halt.
"SHIT!", I yelled.
"Time to play a song."
The group looked around with a "what the fuck" stare.
I went to get a remote that looked like an ordinary TV remote.
"Here… we go!"
I accidentally played a clip from Full Metal Jacket in where Private Pyle was messing with the drill instructor. I showed the screen, it showed that Private Pyle walks into the room and screams "WHAT IS THIS MICKEY MOUSE SHIT?!"
"Uhhhhh…" said Alyssa.
"Chase is a crazy psycho."
"Dude! No one's talking to you, Alyssa! Seriously, shut the fuck up, fucking psychopathic skank."
"Hush.", I said.
"Uh, fuc-", said Alyssa.
"HUSH!", I roared.
He pointed it to the wall. He pressed on the big green button.
Out came a huge puppet show. It had me, Alyssa, and the entire iOS jailbreaking community, even Karen, Vick, Billy, Luca, and Stefan.

The puppets sang a song.

"Alyssa Kuron, Alyssa Kuron,
Thank you very coming over!
Alyssa Kuron, Alyssa Kuron,
We appreciate your torture,
HURRAH,
We cannot stand to see you hurting the iOS users in here,
So if we see doing again, then
We will get Chase to play this again,
Play this again!
ALYSSA
ALYSSA
ALYSSA!!!
HURRAH!
Alyssa Kuron, Alyssa Kuron,
Just be happy with the tweaks we have for you,
Alyssa Kuron, Alyssa Kuron,
I think of you as being a big damn moron,
But of course the world doesn't revolve around you,
You psychopathic bitch that you truly are you
Alyssa KURON, FUCK YOU, BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH!"
Fireworks came out. The puppets were engulfed in flames. Everyone was shell shocked, even Alyssa. They all have a blank stare.
The puppets then sang a distorted version of the first part of the song:
"Alyyyyysaaaa Kur… Kuron! Thaaaank yoouu footer coommming oov-- Alysssaaa! Kuuuurron! Weee apre-- yoouuurrr torrtture! Alysssaa Kur…"
Everyone was scared shitless, even Alyssa.
I stood there clapping. Alyssa scared, Karen quite amused, Luca scared, Billy worried and scared, and Stefan laughing.
"HEHEHEHE! WASN'T THAT JUST AWESOME!"
"Yeah? Yeah?! Come on!"
"You're weird, weirdo. What a world full with crazy and weird shit.", said Alyssa.
Everyone stood laughing, including me, Stefan, Billy, Luca, Karen and Vick.

After they had a great time trying to get to know each other for hours and hours and after Alyssa calmed down 5 minutes later after that weird puppet show and her fight with Vick and Karen, it was 8:30 at night. It was bedtime.

They all went up to their bedrooms upstairs.
Alyssa and I were going to sleep with each other.

Vick, Billy, Karen, Luca, and Stefan all had separated rooms.

"Goodnight!", they said to each other.
