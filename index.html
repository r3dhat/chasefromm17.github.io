licensed under ABHS & ABRR (Anyone But Hamza Sood & Anyone But Ryan Reid/rg0rd) license (in a way) & wtfpl

<hr/>

<b></b>


my tweaks and other relatively minor projects that many stupid and inept people find are worthless because of their retardation level on top of other other's code are licensed under the ABHS & ABRR ("Anyone But Hamza Sood and Anyone But Ryan Reid") license.
note that an additional exception to the license is added, forbidding use/redistribution of said content to Hamza Sood's or Ryan Reid's
friend as well, but only when in a 5 mile radius from "Hamza Sood" or "Ryan Reid/rg0rd" while holding any sort of Twitter convo with them.

note that this license will only be used as long as the discovery of the springboard intenal prototype tools/settings by hamzasood ("Hamza Sood") and rg0rd ("Ryan Reid") are not under the MIT license. 
afterwards, all exceptions are cleared and basically WTFPL applies

if you need a copy of the rest of the license feel free to google it or something.
