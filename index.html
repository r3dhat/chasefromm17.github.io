<h1>My name is Chase Fromm.</h1>

<br>

<h2>I jailbreak iOS, I mostly dedicate time to make tweaks, and sometimes (or occasionally?) themes.</h2>

<br>

<h2>Naturally, I go around and about doing nothing more than watch anime, watch Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Full Metal Jacket, and just be silly to friends online.</h2>

<br>

<h2>I also like to hack iOS â‰¥ iOS 6/7 in search and in hopes of finding some really cool internal stuff.</h2>

<br>

<h2>I made InternalSettings11, a Springtomize/mikoto/Calypso competitor and alternative for Apple's internal and hidden settings. To find out more about InternalSettings11, visit <a href="chasefromm17.yourepo.com">http://chasefromm17.yourepo.com.</a></h2>

<h2>Thanks for visiting my website.</h2>
