my tweaks on top of other's code are licensed under the ABHS & ABRR ("Anyone But Hamza Sood and Anyone But Ryan Reid") license.
note that an additional exception to the license is added, forbidding use/redistribution of said content to Hamza Sood's or Ryan Reid's
friend as well, but only when in a 5 mile radius from "Hamza Sood" or "Ryan Reid/rg0rd" while holding any sort of Twitter convo with them.

note that this license will only be used as long as the discovery of the springboard intenal prototype tools/settings by hamzasood ("Hamza Sood") and rg0rd ("Ryan Reid") are not under the MIT license. 
afterwards, all exceptions are cleared and basically WTFPL applies

if you need a copy of the rest of the license feel free to google it or something.
