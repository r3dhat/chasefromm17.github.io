My name is Chase Fromm.

I jailbreak iOS, I make some apps; mostly dedicate time to tweaks, sometimes (occasionally?) themes.

Naturally, I go around and about doing nothing more than watch anime, watch Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Full Metal Jacket, and just be silly to friends online.

I also like to hack iOS â‰¥ iOS 6/7 in search and in hopes of finding some really cool internal stuff.

I made InternalSettings11, a Springtomize/mikoto/Calypso competitor and alternative for Apple's internal and hidden settings. To find out more about InternalSettings11 by visiting chasefromm17.yourepo.com.
