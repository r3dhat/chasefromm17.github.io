<h1>My name is Chase Fromm.</h1>

<br>

I jailbreak iOS, I mostly dedicate time to make tweaks, and sometimes (or occasionally?) themes.

<br>

Naturally, I go around and about doing nothing more than watch anime, watch Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Full Metal Jacket, and just be silly to friends online.

<br>

I also like to hack iOS â‰¥ iOS 6/7 in search and in hopes of finding some really cool internal stuff.

<br>

I made InternalSettings11, a Springtomize/mikoto/Calypso competitor and alternative for Apple's internal and hidden settings.

To find out more about InternalSettings11, visit <a href="chasefromm17.yourepo.com">http://chasefromm17.yourepo.com.</a>

Thanks for visiting my website.
