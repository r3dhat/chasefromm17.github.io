JailbreakReactivator9!

**WARNING**: **JAILBREAKREACTIVATOR9 IS CURRENTLY IT'S BETA STAGE! DON'T HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE IF THIS SOMEHOW MESSED UP AND FORCES YOU TO RESTORE IN ITUNES OR IF ANYTHING WRONG HAPPENS!**

**NOTE**: **THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH EITHER THE PHOENIXPWN, EXTRA_RECIPE/MACH_PORTAL, YALU102, OR SAIGON JAILBREAK; IT IS ONLY APPLICABLE FOR THE PANGU9.2-9.3.3 JAILBREAK-COMPATIBLE IOS DEVICES!**

JailbreakReactivator9 is just a website shortcut that is supposed to be used to reactivate your iOS 9.2-9.3.3 ARM64-bit jailbreak, no need for Julio's webclip - available & obtainable from his repo if you have it in Cydia: julio.xarold.com (possibly from julioverne.github.io), and no need to use jbme.qwertyoruiop.com anymore. Just make sure your device is *already jailbroken*, rebooted, and then just use Safari (Chrome, Firefox, etc. won't work), and navigate to "chasefromm17.github.io/jbreactivator9" (or navigating to <a href="https://chasefromm17.github.io/jbreactivator9">the jailbreakreactivator9 page</h2></a> will do fine), & then just tap on the "Reactivate jailbroken mode again" button, and then wait for an alert to pop up to ask you to lock your device and wait for it to re-enter in jailbroken mode again!

To clarify: **NO**, this is **NOT A JAILBREAK**, it's a **loader**; there's a difference between a "first-time jailbreak" (as I call it), and a jailbreak that you need to re-apply/re-enter again, so it's only of use if you jailbroke with the Pangu iOS 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreak and rebooted the device into unjailbroken state.

In practice, this will take multiple tries.

In summary, tool will help you simply regain your simple jailbreak functionality, and it's as simple as that.
