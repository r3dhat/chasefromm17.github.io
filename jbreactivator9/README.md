JailbreakReactivator9!

**WARNING**: **JAILBREAKREACTIVATOR9 IS CURRENTLY IT'S EARLY BETA STAGE! DON'T HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE IF THIS SOMEHOW MESSED UP AND FORCES YOU TO RESTORE IN ITUNES OR IF ANYTHING WRONG HAPPENS!**

**NOTE**: **THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH EITHER THE PHOENIXPWN, EXTRA_RECIPE/MACH_PORTAL, YALU102, OR SAIGON JAILBREAK; IT IS ONLY APPLICABLE FOR THE PANGU9.2-9.3.3 JAILBREAK-COMPATIBLE IOS DEVICES!**

JailbreakReactivator9 is just a website shortcut that is supposed to be used to reactivate your iOS 9.2-9.3.3 ARM64-bit jailbreak, no need for Julio's webclip - availble on his repo: julio.xarold.com (possibly from julioverne.github.io), or to use jbme.qwertyoruiop.com anymore. Just make sure your device is *already jailbroken*, rebooted, and then just visit this in Safari (Chrome, Firefox, etc. won't work), and navigate to "chasefromm17.github.io/jbreactivator9" (or navigating to <a href="https://chasefromm17.github.io/jbreactivator9">my main web page</h2></a> will do just fine, then just tap on the "Reactivate the iOS 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreak state"), tap on the "Reactivate jailbroken mode again" button, then wait for an alert to pop up to lock your iOS device and wait for it to re-enter in jailbroken mode!

To clarify: **NO**, this is **NOT A JAILBREAK**, it's a **loader**; there's a difference between a "first-time jailbreak" (as I call it), and a jailbreak that you need to re-apply/re-enter again, so it's only of use if you jailbroke with the Pangu iOS 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreak and rebooted the device into unjailbroken state.

This tool will help you simply regain your simple jailbreak functionality, and it's as simple as that.
